Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

Motion capture technology was used in the movie "Avatar" to create realistic character movements and expressions. This technology makes the character's movements more natural and smooth by capturing the actor's movements and converting them into the animation of the digital character. This technology was chosen as inspiration because it enhances the user experience and makes the characters in the animation design more vivid and realistic. While this advanced technology may not be fully implemented in this course, a simplified version of it can help inspire innovation and technological exploration.

Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

Selected Coding Technique: Simple character animation using JavaScript and the p5.js library.

Using the animation functions and JavaScript in p5.js, you can simulate simple dynamic capture effects and control the movements of virtual characters through programming. Although it cannot fully achieve the effect of professional motion capture technology, this method can achieve basic animation and user interaction in the browser, providing users with more intuitive visual feedback.
